# Quantum Squares âœ¨

Quantum Squares is a web-based game where two players compete to dominate a grid of blocks. Each player takes turns adding pieces to the blocks, and the goal is to reach a score of 10 to win the game.

## How to Play

1. Player 1 starts the game.
2. Click on a block to add a piece.
3. If a block reaches 4 pieces, it will blast and distribute pieces to adjacent blocks.
4. The game checks for a winner after each move. The first player to reach a score of 10 wins.
5. Illegal moves (adding pieces to an opponent's block) are not allowed and will trigger an error sound.
